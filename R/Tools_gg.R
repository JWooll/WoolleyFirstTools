#'
#' Uses the ggplot function with na data points eliminated
#' User must call the function with the data set being used
#' (in this case the user will probably use the included data set AAF)
#' The X column they would like to use and the Y column they would like to use
#' Both need to be in quotes
#' and finally the type of graph they would like to make
#' eg. 'geom_point()','geom_jitter()','geom_line()' etc.
